# CodeClause_FakeNewsDetection
In this data science project, I have used Python to build a model that can accurately detect whether a piece of news is real or fake. 
I have successfully built a TfidfVectorizer and used a PassiveAggressiveClassifier to classify news into "Real" and "Fake" categories.
